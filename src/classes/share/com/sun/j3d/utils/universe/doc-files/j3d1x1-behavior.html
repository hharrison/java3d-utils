// concrete subclass of the abstract ViewPlatformBehavior with a parameterless
// constructor could be used.  The logical name to assign to this behavior is
// specified by the 2nd argument to the NewViewPlatformBehavior command, while
// the 3rd argument is the name of the ViewPlatformBehavior subclass.  It is
// instantiated through introspection.

// ((0.0 1.0 2.0 0.5) (3.0 4.0 5.0 1.0) (6.0 7.0 8.0 0.0)) get converted to

// need to be specified; it is implicitly (0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0).

// The REVERSE_ALL flags are usually passed to the OrbitBehavior constructor.
// Since it is being instantiated with its parameterless constructor the
// reverse flags are set here explicitly.
