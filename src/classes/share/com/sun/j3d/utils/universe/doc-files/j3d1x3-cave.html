 * 
 * The projectors in the VirtualPortal sample site are actually turned
 * on their sides to get more height.  Screen 0 is rotated 90 degrees
 * counter-clockwise, while screens 1 and 2 are rotated 90 degrees
 * clockwise.

// describe the position and orientation of the screens relative to the
// environment.

// From the orientation of a user standing within this VirtualPortal site and
// facing the center screen, the tracker base is along the vertical midline of
// the screen, 0.248 meters down from the top edge, and 1.340 meters in front
// of it.  The tracker base is oriented so that its +X axis points to the left,
// its +Y axis points toward the screen, and its +Z axis points toward the
// floor.
